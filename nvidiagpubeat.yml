################### Nvidiagpubeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Nvidiagpubeat ######################################

nvidiagpubeat:
  # Defines how often an event is sent to the output
  period: 1s
  # By default the query of type query-gpu is executed to support backward compatibility
  # query: "name,gpu_bus_id,gpu_serial,gpu_uuid,driver_version,count,index,fan.speed,memory.total,memory.used,utilization.gpu,utilization.memory,temperature.gpu,power.draw,power.limit,clocks.gr,clocks.sm,clocks.mem,pstate"
  # A generic version of query is supported by nvidiagpubeat for query options like --query-gpu,--query-compute-apps and others.
  # -query-gpu will provide information about GPU.
  query: "--query-gpu=name,gpu_bus_id,gpu_serial,gpu_uuid,driver_version,count,index,fan.speed,memory.total,memory.used,utilization.gpu,utilization.memory,temperature.gpu,power.draw,power.limit,clocks.gr,clocks.sm,clocks.mem,pstate"
  # --query-compute-apps will list currently active compute processes.
  # query: "--query-compute-apps=gpu_name,gpu_bus_id,gpu_serial,gpu_uuid,pid,process_name,used_gpu_memory,used_memory"
  env: "test"
  # env can be test or production. test is for test purposes to evaluate funcationality of this beat. Switch to production
  # when you want to run this beat on a Nvidia GPU machine with SMI driver installed.

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]
